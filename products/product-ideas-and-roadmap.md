# Product Naming & Ideas

All Ribbon products follow this naming convention:

`Series <Series Number> - <Product Name>`

Each product belongs to a Series and have their individual product names. An example of this is `Series Y - Theta Vault`.

Each Series in Ribbon serve a particular purpose for our users:

| Series | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Series Y - Yield | Enhanced yields for crypto assets |
| Series V - Volatility | Speculating on volatility of crypto assets |
| Series S - Safe | Principal-protected methods of generating returns on crypto assets |

## Product Ideas

### Series Y \(Yield\)

* Covered Call selling \(in development\)
* Put selling

### Series V \(Volatility\)

* Strangle / Straddle \(online\)
* Iron condor

### Series S \(Safe\)

* Princial protected notes
* Married puts
