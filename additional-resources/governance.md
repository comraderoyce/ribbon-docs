# Governance

The Ribbon Community uses RBN tokens to govern the protocol, by voting on proposals called Ribbon Governance Proposals (RGPs). Anyone can propose a change to the system by starting a discussion in the forum, however it requires a minimum of 62,500 RBN to submit a snapshot vote. Visit the forum and resources below to learn more.
