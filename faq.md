# FAQ

## What are structured products?

Structured products are packaged financial instruments that use a combination of derivatives to achieve some specific risk-return objective, such as betting on volatility, enhancing yields or principal protection.

## How are the products structured?

The products are structured by combining multiple derivatives on-chain. For example, the ETH Strangle product combines a put and a call option from Hegic and Opyn. Ribbon plans to integrate with more options protocols over time.

## Does Ribbon have a token?

Yes, we have a token. You can find more information about the $RBN Airdrop and contract [here](https://ribbonfinance.medium.com/rbn-airdrop-distribution-70b6cb0b870c). The token is currently non-transferable. Be aware that there are scammers that have created fake Ribbon tokens and are actively distributing them on DEXes. Do not buy them. Official RBN address: [0x6123B0049F904d730dB3C36a31167D9d4121fA6B](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6123B0049F904d730dB3C36a31167D9d4121fA6B).

## What is the security of Ribbon contracts?

Our v1 Solidity contracts have been audited by [Peckshield](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Ribbon-v1.0.pdf). The v1 contracts do not hold any significant amount of cash, but holds the underlying options positions on behalf of the user. Therefore, there is a risk that users will lose their positions in the event of a hack. Users are encouraged to only risk funds that they are willing to lose.
