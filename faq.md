# FAQ

## What are structured products?

Structured products are packaged financial instruments that use a combination of derivatives to achieve some specific risk-return objective, such as betting on volatility, enhancing yields or principal protection.

## How are the products structured?

The products are structured by combining multiple derivatives on-chain. For example, the ETH Strangle product combines a put and a call option from Hegic and Opyn. Ribbon plans to integrate with more options protocols over time.

## Does Ribbon have a token?

No, we do not have a token. We are aware that there are scammers that have created fake Ribbon tokens and are actively distributing them on DEXes. Do not buy them.

## What is the security of Ribbon contracts?

Our v1 Solidity contracts are not audited yet, and as such must be treated as alpha software. Users are encouraged to only risk funds that they are willing to lose. The v1 contracts do not hold any significant amount of cash, but holds the underlying options positions on behalf of the user. Therefore, there is a risk that users will lose their positions in the event of a hack.

The Series Y product is undergoing an audit, details of this audit will be publicly posted once it is complete.
