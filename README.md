## Core Products

### Series V - Strangle

Series V is a series of products that allows users to speculate on volatility.

A [strangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangle_%28options%29) is an options strategy in which the investor holds a call and a put position at different strike prices. A strangle is a good strategy if you think the underlying asset will experience a large price movement in the near future, but are unsure of the direction. Strangles help liquidity providers to hedge the risk of impermanent loss as it is a long volatility strategy.

Ribbon's Strangle contracts are expiring contracts that help traders to construct a strangle position on-chain. It utilizes multiple on-chain protocols to find the best price for a put and a call option.  


### Series Y - Theta Vault

Series Y is a series of products focused on generating yields with short volatility strategies.

Theta Vault, which is a yield-focused strategy on ETH and WBTC. The first Theta Vault will run a [covered call](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp) strategy, which earns yield on a weekly basis through writing out of the money covered calls and collecting the premiums. Read the product page for more details about how Theta Vaults work.
