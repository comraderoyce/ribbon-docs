## Audits

Ribbon's Theta Vault is audited, please see [Peckshield's audit report](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Ribbon-v1.0.pdf). To be specific, below are the contracts that are audited:

* [RibbonFactory](https://github.com/ribbon-finance/structured-products/blob/master/contracts/RibbonFactory.sol)
* [GammaAdapter](https://github.com/ribbon-finance/structured-products/blob/master/contracts/adapters/GammaAdapter.sol)
* [RibbonCoveredCall](https://github.com/ribbon-finance/structured-products/blob/master/contracts/instruments/RibbonCoveredCall.sol)

The rest of the smart contract code released by Ribbon are not audited yet and should be treated as alpha software. We advice users to exercise caution and to not risk funds they are not willing to lose.
